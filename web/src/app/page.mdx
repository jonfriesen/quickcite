## It's Alive! Our Chrome Extension Has Escaped the Lab {{ date: '2024-08-21T00:00Z' }}

After countless nights of coding, an unhealthy amount of caffeine, and more "it works on my machine" moments than we'd care to admit, our Chrome extension is finally out in the wild!


<Link href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/quickcite/bdkbkefnpcenapogkehakcgmffjbbkif" target='_blank'>
    <div className="flex justify-center items-center ">
        <IconChrome className="h-5 w-auto flex-none mr-2" />
        <span className="mr-2">Add to Chrome</span>
    </div>
</Link>

### <SparkleIcon /> What's the Big Deal?

- Multi-site Support: GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram - we're playing the field, baby!
- Customizable Prefixes: Because sometimes you need that emoji flair in your links.
- Theme Options: Dark, light, or synthwave - choose your fighter!
- User-Configurable Settings: Turn sites on/off faster than you can say "feature creep".
- Slick UI: Buttons so pretty, you'll want to click them even when you don't need to.

## Lights, Camera, Extension! {{ date: '2024-08-19T00:00Z' }}

Hold onto your keyboards, folks! We've just dropped a product tour video that's so exciting, it might make your coffee jealous.

### <SparkleIcon /> What's the Big Deal?

- Created a mind-blowing product tour video. With ScarJo level AI voiceover! 
- Showcased all the fancy features we've been bragging about. Now you can see the magic in action!
- Proved that developers can indeed create content that doesn't put people to sleep. Take that, boring tutorials!
- Added some slick transitions because we're all about that polish. It's so smooth, you might slip off your chair.

Is a product tour video necessary for a browser extension? Probably not. Did we make one anyway? You bet your commit history we did!

<div className="flex justify-center items-center">
    <YouTubeVideoButton videoUrl="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCF5vnF3Dmw" />

## Who Doesn't Love Options? {{ date: '2024-08-18T00:00Z' }}

Alright, folks! Buckle up because this update is a game-changer. I've added user-configurable site settings to our little extension. Why? Because I believe in the power of choice (and maybe because I got tired of hard-coding everything).

### <SparkleIcon /> What's New

- You can now enable/disable specific sites. Don't use Instagram? Turn it off! Love GitHub? Keep it on!
- Customize those fancy prefixes. Want your GitHub links to start with üêô? Go wild!
- Added LinkedIn and Instagram support. Because why stop at just one social media platform, right?
- Threw in unique icons for markdown and plain text. Because sometimes words just aren't enough.
- Got the extension ready for publishing. Time to unleash this beast upon the world!

Is this overkill for a side project? Probably. Am I going to stop? Absolutely not.

## One Extension to Rule Them All {{ date: '2024-08-17T00:00Z' }}

Ladies and gentlemen, we have liftoff! Multi-site functionality is complete, and I'm feeling like a coding wizard (or at least a very caffeinated developer).

### <SparkleIcon /> The Good Stuff

- Multi-site functionality is DONE. GitHub, watch your back ‚Äì you're not the only site in town anymore.
- Implemented Vite and Rollup. Because apparently, I hate myself and love complex build processes.
- Added my name as the author. Fame and glory, here I come!
- Made the popup look less like it was designed by a sleep-deprived developer. (Spoiler: it was)

Sure, it took way longer than expected, and I may have forgotten to eat a few meals, but who's counting?

## Buttons, Buttons, Everywhere {{ date: '2024-08-17T00:00Z' }}

In a shocking turn of events, I decided that one button design wasn't enough. Now we have themes because... why not?

### <SparkleIcon /> The Fancy Bits

- Added dark, light, and syncwave button themes. Because choice is good, and I couldn't decide which one I liked best.
- Made a theme picker. It's like a color wheel, but for indecisive developers.
- Extracted icons into separate files. Marie Kondo would be proud of this organization.
- Made the buttons prettier. You're welcome, eyeballs of the world.
- Cleaned up the popup. It's like spring cleaning, but for code.

Is any of this necessary? Nope. Is it fun? You bet!

## The One Where It All Began {{ date: '2024-08-17T00:00Z' }}

Oh my! The first version of this extension is out, and it's... well, it's something.

### <SparkleIcon /> The Bare Bones

- Made it work with GitHub PRs. Because who doesn't love a good pull request?
- Added a copy button. It's not much, but it's honest work.
- Created a popup that doesn't make your eyes bleed (too much).
- Laid the groundwork for future features. Future me, you're welcome.

Is it perfect? No. Is it functional? Mostly. Did I stay up way too late coding this? Absolutely.

And thus, a side project was born. Will it change the world? Probably not. But it might save you a few clicks, and really, isn't that what life is all about?

Stay tuned for more updates, or don't. I'll probably keep coding either way!
